# Tennis Match Analysis Tool

## Overview
The **Tennis Match Analysis Tool** is a computer vision-based project designed to analyze tennis match videos. It provides detailed insights into player movements, ball speeds, and match dynamics. With plans for future enhancements such as pose estimation and player stats tracking, this tool aims to be a comprehensive solution for analyzing tennis matches using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## Features

### 1. Player Detection and Tracking
- Utilizes **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for accurate detection and tracking of players and the tennis ball in video frames.

### 2. Court Keypoints Extraction
- Implements **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract and detect tennis court lines and keypoints, ensuring precise spatial analysis.

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Measures:
  - **Player Speed**: Tracks player movements during gameplay.
  - **Ball Shot Speed**: Calculates the speed of the ball during each shot.
  - **Number of Shots**: Counts the total number of shots in a match.

### 4. Future Enhancements
- **Pose Estimation**: Track and analyze player poses for better performance insights.
- **Player Stats Tracking**: Provide detailed statistics about individual player performance.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation
- Prepare a dataset of tennis match videos.
- Annotate data to include labels for players, balls, and court keypoints.

### 2. Model Architecture
- YOLO is used for real-time object detection of players and the ball.
- A pretrained **CNN model** is utilized for detecting court lines and keypoints.

### 3. Metrics Calculation
- Speed measurements are derived using frame-by-frame object tracking.
- Shot counts are calculated based on ball movement patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [Insert GitHub link here]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tennis-match-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download pretrained models and place them in the appropriate directory (e.g., `models/`).

5. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Place your input video files in the `input/` directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analyze_video.py --input input/video.mp4 --output output/
   ```
3. Results (player tracking, ball tracking, and metrics) will be saved in the `output/` directory.
